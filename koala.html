                   <h3>Koala</h3> 
                   <P>The koalas shape is similar to the wombat which is its closest living relative, but the koala has longer limbs.

 

They have soft wool-like grey fur with patches of white on their stomach, chest and chin and a fringe of white around their ears. They have a round head with a large black nose. They have a small tail that is mostly hidden by their fur.
