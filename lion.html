                   <p>“There is nothing in life that I love more than searching each day for that one lion. That one truly wild and free animal that few ever see. It can take days, weeks even months to find the one but so worth it at the end.
I enjoy the actual tracking and work going into finding the lion more than actually seeing them. That a bit weird? Possibly; however without passion it makes life and your job a lot harder. Luckily I have more passion for what I do than brains.
This lion (photo below) is wild and free, free to come and go and free to make decisions that are seldom triggered by human presence. True WILD LIONS will choose whether they want you to see them or not, and that is what makes working with wild lions so special………YOU NEVER KNOW.”
