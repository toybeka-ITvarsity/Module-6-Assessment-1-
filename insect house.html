                   Insect Zoo, Los Angeles Natural History Museum
With residents like the white-eyed assassin bug, this permanent exhibit seems destined for a Hollywood thriller. The museum, along with Western Exterminator pest control company, also sponsors the 31st annual Bug Fair, May 20-21, offering insect hunts, puppet walks and cooking demonstrations with bug chefs. “It’s a fun day for everyone,” says White, who says he can whip up a mean batch of “bugaboo” brownies made with mealworm flour. nhm.org
